<h2>Description:</h2> In this first of many projects, I have created a game that we all know and love, Tic-Tac-Toe. This app, is a deployed, functioning and interactive webpage for users designed with HTML/CSS/Javascript. The application is personalized as each user is asked to create an account and sign in to play our wonderful game. Users are encouraged to come train their Tic-Tac-Toe skills to be better than all of their friends.

<h2>User Story:</h2> User should be able to sign-up, sign-in and sign-out. The user should have the option to create a game, thus prompting the presentation of the game board with the option to play a game, choose either X or O and then rotate between them on only open spaces. Once the board is full or someone has won, the user should be given a message of the win, loss, or tie, and the user may no longer add to the board. Once the game is over, the user should have the option to play again or sign-out.
